## Viewership Dataset

We use publicly available data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_episodes) that contains episode-level viewership in millions.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

got <- read_csv("got_viewership.csv")
head(got)
```

## Basic Statistics

```{r}
got %>%
  summarise(
    mean_viewers = mean(Viewers_Million),
    max_viewers = max(Viewers_Million),
    min_viewers = min(Viewers_Million)
  )
```

## Viewership Over Time

```{r}
ggplot(got, aes(x = Episode, y = Viewers_Million, group = Season, color = as.factor(Season))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Game of Thrones Viewership by Episode",
       x = "Episode Number",
       y = "Viewers (Millions)",
       color = "Season")
```

## Season-to-Season Viewership

```{r}
season_avg <- got %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(Average_Views = mean(Viewers_Million))

ggplot(season_avg, aes(x = factor(Season), y = Average_Views, fill = factor(Season))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Average Viewership by Season",
       x = "Season",
       y = "Average Viewers (Millions)")
```

## Observations

Between season 1 and season 8, the viewership increased significantly from an average of approximately 2.5 million to over 12 million. However, some fluctuation is seen in season 5 and season 6, before peaking in season 8.
